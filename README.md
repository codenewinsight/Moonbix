**Instructions:**

**NODE.JS MUST BE INSTALLED FIRST**

Run the following command to install the necessary modules:

```bash
npm install
```

Create two files: `data.txt` and `proxy.txt`.

For those using multiple accounts, it’s recommended to use a proxy 
(if using only one account, you don’t need to create the `proxy.txt` file).

**Proxy format:**  
`http://user:pass@ip:port`

In the `data.txt` file, the format should be:

`query_id=xxxx` or `user_id=xxxx`

Run the tool with the following command:

```bash
node moonbix.js
```
or  
```bash
node moonbix-proxy.js
```
